### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew McPhail,

A data/analytics enthusiast passionate about data :bar_chart:. I like automating things, building pipelines, cleaning data and exploring data problems that help improve business decision making.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimising our internal data warehouse. It's a fairly straightforward hosted postgres data warehouse. We use dbt for our modelling and transformation and SQLModel for defining our source data and executing on our ingestion pipelines.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working my way through the Google Data Analytics Certification.
- âœ¨ I enjoy working with dbt, SQL and python.
